## Project Overview üéØ ##
Tourists, who are unfamiliar with Singapore, may face difficulties in navigating around the country and they may spend the bulk of their days finding information to plan their journey. This may diminish their traveling experience and affect the likelihood of them returning to Singapore.

After doing extensive market research, we found that there are existing applications to enhance tourists' traveling experience. However, these existing applications only target specific aspects of the traveling experience. They either target transportation or attraction site recommendations. As such, users will have to toggle between different applications to satisfy their travel needs.

Hence, we want to provide tourists with a one-stop travel application that enhances tourists' traveling experience by offering:
1. Site Recommendations
2. Navigation Assistance
3. Travel Planner
